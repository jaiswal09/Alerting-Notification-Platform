ALERTING & NOTIFICATION PLATFORM - SETUP GUIDE
=====================================================

This guide will help you set up and run the Alerting & Notification Platform on your computer, 
even if you've never coded before.

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
--------------------
This is a professional notification system that allows:
- Admins to create and manage alerts for their organization
- Users to receive notifications and manage their alert preferences
- Real-time analytics and reporting
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

PREREQUISITES (Software you need to install)
===========================================

1. INSTALL NODE.JS
   - Go to https://nodejs.org/
   - Download the "LTS" version (Long Term Support)
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions
   - This installs Node.js (JavaScript runtime) and npm (package manager)

2. INSTALL A CODE EDITOR (Optional but recommended)
   - Download Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - This helps you view and edit code files

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================

STEP 1: Download the Project
---------------------------
- The project files should already be in a folder on your computer
- Open a terminal/command prompt:
  * Windows: Press Windows key + R, type "cmd", press Enter
  * Mac: Press Cmd + Space, type "terminal", press Enter
  * Linux: Press Ctrl + Alt + T

STEP 2: Navigate to Project Folder
----------------------------------
- In the terminal, type: cd path/to/your/project/folder
- Replace "path/to/your/project/folder" with the actual path
- Press Enter

STEP 3: Install Dependencies
---------------------------
- Type: npm install
- Press Enter
- Wait for installation to complete (this downloads required libraries)

STEP 4: Set Up Environment Variables
-----------------------------------
- A file called .env has been created with default settings
- You can use these default values for testing
- For production, you would change these to real values

STEP 5: Set Up the Database
--------------------------
- Type: npm run setup:db
- Press Enter
- This creates the database and sample data for testing

STEP 6: Start the Application
----------------------------
- Type: npm run dev
- Press Enter
- You should see: "Server running on http://localhost:3001"

STEP 7: Test the Application
---------------------------
- Open your web browser
- Go to: http://localhost:3001
- You should see the notification platform interface

TESTING THE SYSTEM
==================

Default Test Accounts:
- Admin User: admin@company.com (password: admin123)
- Regular User: john@company.com (password: user123)
- Regular User: jane@company.com (password: user123)

Test API Endpoints:
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3001
- API Documentation: http://localhost:3001/api/docs
- Health Check: http://localhost:3001/api/health

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Problem: "npm: command not found"
Solution: Node.js is not installed. Go back to Step 1.

Problem: "Permission denied"
Solution: 
- Windows: Run command prompt as Administrator
- Mac/Linux: Add "sudo " before the command

Problem: "Port 3001 already in use"
Solution: 
- Close any other applications using port 3001
- Or change the port in .env file

Problem: Database connection errors
Solution: 
- Make sure you ran "npm run setup:db"
- Check if any antivirus is blocking the application

STOPPING THE APPLICATION
========================
- In the terminal where the app is running
- Press Ctrl + C (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + C (Mac)
- Type "Y" if asked to terminate
